# Movie Recommender System
This is an end to end movie recommendation system project which works on the concept of content based recommendation, where the movies are recommended based on the similarity between the contents present in the movie's tags, such as description, actors, directors etc.

In this project, I have used the data sets offered by TMDB that contains various movies and also the informations regarding the movies.

This project also involves some Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts such as stop words removal, Stemming, Bag of words etc.
